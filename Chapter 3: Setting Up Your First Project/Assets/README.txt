This Chapter contains Project Assets that will be used for building the landing page of a fictional food delivery app called SecondPlate.
The webpage will be built entirely in Webflow.

In order to use the assets, download all the files in the Assets folder and upload or drag and drop them into your Webflow Project Assets section.
